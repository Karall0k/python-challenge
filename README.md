Module 3 Challenge
Model 3 Python Challenge required two sets of code to evaluate two data sets: 
1. PyBank
2. PyPoll

PyBank involves reading a .csv file with dates of profit and loss data to answer the following questions:
    The total number of months included in the dataset
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The code then prints the answers to the terminal and also creates a new text file in a separate folder from the main python file.

PyPoll involves reading a .csv file with three columns of data to answer the following questions
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
The code then prints the answers to the terminal and also creates a new text file in a separate folder from the main python file.

The following sources were consulted and used to create these codes:
